# BUILDING-A-COMPREHENSIVE-CHATBOT-PERSONAL-ASSISTANT
The objective of the OpenChat PDF Chatbot application is to provide an interactive and customizable platform where users can upload PDF documents and engage in a conversation with an AI chatbot (powered by Google's Gemini API). The chatbot is capable of understanding and answering questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF. The application also includes user-configurable settings for UI/UX preferences (like font size and theme), allows screen recording of the chat session, and enables downloading the recorded video. Additional utilities like clearing the cache and re-running the app are also provided for enhanced usability.
